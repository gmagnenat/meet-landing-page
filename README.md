## My process

- Setup the project structure for my workflow with scss
- Setup the scss variables based on the design system provided
- Start implementing the mobile version
- Refactor code with mixins
- Add breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- Refactor some sizes with clamp for fluid changes between breakpoint
- Finetuning with perfectPixel to get closer to the design

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to make image float outside of the screen size (1440px) but make
them still visible for larger screen.

The parent needs to have an overflow hidden and the max-width need to be large enough to contain the overflowed image.

```css
&__illustration__image {
  max-width: calc(100% + 4rem);
  margin-left: -2rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll keep refactoring the html and scss. I have the feeling there are a lot of small
tweaking on individual elements such as font-sizes, line-height, letter-spacing that could be harmonised and easier to handle.
